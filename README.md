## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [network monitor](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/CS372/netmonitor) using Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C by going through [The C Programming Language](https://github.com/mCaballero1224/the_c_programming_language) by Brian Kerringhan and Dennis Ritchie.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on small projects.
- 📫 Reach me at my [site](https://mcaballero.dev)!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/they
- ⚡ Fun fact: According to ["The Face of Anonymouse (2021)"](https://youtu.be/R8h-fPCvqAg?t=1136) from Storyline Entertainment, the Guy Fawkes masks were chosen due to their availability, as it seemed it was overestimated how popular the masks would be after the movie "V for Vendetta" had debuted.
